# Run tests

* open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Launch Tests`
* press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded
* see the output of the test result in the debug console
* make changes to `test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder
  * by convention, the test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`
  * you can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want
